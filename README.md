# phase-1-project
I wanted to make a simple project that I could use in my everyday life as a firefighter. 
This project has 3 event listeners:
  DOMContentLoaded, change, and click
My project takes a JSON data base and fetches the stations and information on the DOMContent Loaded. It takes a dropdown list with values associated with the id number in the JSON server and upon the change event it states what station you have chosen and displays a short description of the station. Upon the submit button it also takes from the dropdown menu and displays three areas located by the station where a hydrant in located.
